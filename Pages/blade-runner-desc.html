            <strong>Plot</strong><br/>
            Blade Runner is a science fiction film set in a
            dystopian future Los Angeles, 2019. The story follows Rick Deckard
            (Harrison Ford), a retired "Blade Runner," whose job is to track down
            and "retire" (terminate) replicantsâ€”bioengineered humans designed for
            off-world labor. These replicants have escaped to Earth and pose a
            threat to society. As Deckard pursues them, he questions the nature of
            humanity and the ethics of his job.

            <strong>Themes</strong><br/> 
            The film explores themes of identity,
            artificial intelligence, the consequences of technology, and what it
            means to be human. It raises profound philosophical questions about the
            moral implications of creating beings that are almost indistinguishable
            from humans.

            <strong>Visual Style</strong><br/>
            Blade Runner is renowned for its visually
            stunning and influential cyberpunk aesthetic. It's known for its
            neon-lit cityscapes, rain-soaked streets, and a dark, moody atmosphere
            that has had a lasting impact on the science fiction genre.
